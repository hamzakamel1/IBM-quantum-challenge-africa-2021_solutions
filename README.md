# 1- Introduction and the Crop-Yield Problem
Quantum Computing has the potential to revolutionize computing, as it can solve problems that are not possible to solve on a classical computer. This extra ability that quantum computers have is called quantum advantage. To achieve this goal, the world needs passionate and competent end-users: those who know how to apply the technology to their field.

In this challenge you will be exposed, at a high-level, to quantum computing through Qiskit. As current or future users of quantum computers, you need to know what problems are appropriate for quantum computation, how to structure the problem model/inputs so that they are compatible with your chosen algorithm, and how to execute a given algorithm and quantum solution to solve the problem.
