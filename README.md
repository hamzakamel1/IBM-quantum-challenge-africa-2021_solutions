# ibm-quantum-challenge-africa-2021--solutions

The challenge focussed on applications of the field of Quantum Computing to solve problems in Africa in many fields like fields of optimization, finance, chemistry and meditation. As one of the african people from Egypt. Iâ€™m bappy to try to solve the problem that faces Africa. To be one of the people that make a difference in my continent, my country, and my socity. Thanks to IBM quantum computing and its applications.

# IBM Quantum Challenge - Africa 2021 - description 
The challenge consists of three labs covering three different applications of quantum computing. Each lab contains multiple exercises, taking you through the process of setting up your problem model, configuring your quantum algorithm, and solving for your problem by executing your quantum algorithm. Each lab is presented as a Jupyter notebook which is hosted on the IBM Quantum Lab.

## Labs titles: 
### 1- Introduction and the Crop-Yield Problem
### 2- Quantum Speedups in Finance
### 3- Quantum Chemistry for HIV


# 1- Introduction and the Crop-Yield Problem

Quantum Computing has the potential to revolutionize computing, as it can solve problems that are not possible to solve on a classical computer. This extra ability that quantum computers have is called quantum advantage. To achieve this goal, the world needs passionate and competent end-users: those who know how to apply the technology to their field.

In this challenge you will be exposed, at a high-level, to quantum computing through Qiskit. As current or future users of quantum computers, you need to know what problems are appropriate for quantum computation, how to structure the problem model/inputs so that they are compatible with your chosen algorithm, and how to execute a given algorithm and quantum solution to solve the problem.

# 2- Quantum Speedups in Finance
## Notebook objectives:
### In this challenge you will gain the following skills:
#### 1- Understand the basics of how financial instruments are typically priced using Monte Carlo methods
#### 2- Implement a quantum algorithm to price a financial instrument (in this case, we consider derivative contracts called options)
#### 3- Understand the pros/cons of using the quantum approach

The world of finance is a complicated one to model and predict. The financial markets, in particular, are influenced by so many external factors and contain multiple different investors with different objectives. This means that traditional modelling techniques, like multiple linear regression, often struggle when trying to explain investors' behaviours or perform certain tasks in finance, such as predicting the price of a stock. Due to these complexities, we need more sophisticated models and numerous techniques have been proposed to produce such robust models for financial instruments like stocks.

In Africa, the dynamics of the financial markets are arguably even more complicated. In this notebook, we discuss what types of financial instruments we can encounter in the South African market, particularly those that are liquid (meaning they are frequently traded and accurately valued). Illiqid instruments are also prevalent in Africa and are more difficult to evaluate and price, since they are not often traded.

Here, we introduce a common pricing technique for a particular instrument called an option. This technique rests on Monte Carlo sampling which we show can achieve a quadratic speed up in pricing the option by replacing the classical Monte Carlo sampling approach with a quantum algorithm that leverages quantum effects to compute things faster.

HIV has affected many communities, especially in Africa. Though there has been significant research into treatments for the disease, there is still a lot of work to be done. Quantum computers have the promise of revolutionising the way we discover drugs and how we treat illnesses. This lab takes you through a demonstration of calculating whether a given drug would block the binding ability of the viral protein. Using advanced quantum algorithms and cutting-edge research, you will learn how to model and simulate the molecular interaction between the virus and a hypothetical drug.
